# Probability Function Plot using ggplot2

In conducting probability analysis, the two variables that take account of the chance of an event happening are N (number of observations) and λ (lambda – our hit rate/chance of occurrence in a single interval).

Note that the below code can also be written as a function – but I will first write an extended version to illustrate exactly how the calculations are taking place.

Based on the law of large numbers, the larger the number of trials; the larger the probability of an event happening even if the probability within a single trial is very low.

The attached graph demonstrates that even as we have a low probability of occurrence for a lower value of N, we have a higher probability of occurrence for a higher value of N.
